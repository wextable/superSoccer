## Key Implementation Files
- **InteractorFactory**: `SuperSoccer/Sources/Dependency/InteractorFactory.swift`
  - InteractorFactoryProtocol, InteractorFactory, MockInteractorFactory
- **DependencyContainer**: `SuperSoccer/Sources/Dependency/DependencyContainer.swift`
  - MockDependencyContainer with coordinator factory methods
- **Feature Coordinators**: All updated to use InteractorFactory pattern
  - TeamFeatureCoordinator with parameterized factory support
  - Other coordinators with simple factory integration
- **Test Files**: All feature coordinator tests updated to use MockDependencyContainer pattern

## Important Code Patterns

### InteractorFactory Usage Pattern
```swift
// Production (in FeatureCoordinator)
init(navigationCoordinator: NavigationCoordinatorProtocol,
     interactorFactory: InteractorFactoryProtocol) {
    let interactor = interactorFactory.makeTeamInteractor(userTeamId: userTeamId)
    interactor.delegate = self
}

// Testing (in Tests)
let container = MockDependencyContainer()
let coordinator = container.makeTeamCoordinator(userTeamId: "team1")
```

### Factory Interface Pattern
```swift
protocol InteractorFactoryProtocol {
    // Simple interactors
    func makeNewGameInteractor() -> NewGameInteractorProtocol
    func makeMainMenuInteractor() -> MainMenuInteractorProtocol
    func makeTeamSelectInteractor() -> TeamSelectInteractorProtocol
    
    // Parameterized interactors
    func makeTeamInteractor(userTeamId: String) -> TeamInteractorProtocol
}
```

This architecture provides type-safe, testable, and scalable dependency injection for all features while maintaining clean separation of concerns and comprehensive testing support.
