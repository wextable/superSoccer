# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The SuperSoccer project is in active development with a clean architecture foundation established. The core data layer has been recently refactored to implement a proper 3-layer architecture.

## Recent Major Changes

### Data Architecture Refactor (Recently Completed)
- **Eliminated RequestProcessor Pattern**: Removed complex RequestProcessor classes in favor of simpler DataManager + Transformers approach
- **Implemented 3-Layer Architecture**: SwiftDataStorage â†’ DataManager â†’ Transformers
- **Created Transformation Layer**: ClientToSwiftDataTransformer and SwiftDataToClientTransformer for model conversion
- **Established Model Boundaries**: Strict separation between Client models and SwiftData models

### Current Implementation Status

#### âœ… Completed Features
- **MainMenu**: Career management entry point with continue/new career options
- **NewGame**: Coach profile creation and team selection flow
- **TeamSelect**: Team selection interface with thumbnail views
- **Team**: Basic team overview showing roster and team information
- **Data Layer**: Complete 3-layer architecture with transformers
- **Navigation**: Coordinator pattern with BaseFeatureCoordinator and child management
- **Design System**: Complete SuperSoccer Design System with retro-inspired theming
  - Starbyte Super Soccer inspired color palette
  - Typography system with SF Mono headers
  - Button components (Primary, Secondary, Text)
  - Text components (Titles, Labels with hierarchy)
  - Theme system with proper light/dark mode support
  - SSThemeProvider for automatic color scheme detection
  - Fixed dark mode text visibility bug

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Tab Navigation System**: TabNavigationCoordinator and TabContainerView implementation
- **InGame Coordinator**: Basic structure exists but needs full implementation
- **Data Manager Integration**: SwiftDataManagerFactory needs transformer injection

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Build and Test Current Architecture
- Build project in Xcode to resolve any import dependencies
- Test the new data layer architecture end-to-end
- Verify career creation flow works with new transformers

### 2. Complete Navigation System
- Finish TabNavigationCoordinator implementation
- Integrate tab-based navigation for in-game features
- Test navigation flow between features

### 3. Implement Core Game Features
- **League Feature**: League standings, schedule, and match results
- **Match Simulation**: Basic match simulation engine
- **Player Management**: Enhanced player details and statistics

## Current Technical Decisions

### Architecture Patterns in Use
- **Clean Architecture**: 3-layer data architecture with strict boundaries
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Feature-based navigation with result types
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based with mock implementations
- **Event-Driven**: EventBus for feature communication
- **Request/Result**: Structured operations for complex data flows

### Key Implementation Preferences
- **Immutable Client Models**: All Client models use `let` properties
- **ID-Based Relationships**: String IDs instead of object references in Client models
- **Protocol Abstractions**: Every service has a protocol with mock implementation
- **SwiftUI + Combine**: Reactive UI with publisher-based data flow

## Active Development Patterns

### Feature Development Flow
1. Create FeatureCoordinator with Result enum
2. Implement Interactor with protocol and mock
3. Build Views with ViewModels for presentation state
4. Add comprehensive unit tests
5. Integrate with navigation system

### Data Operations Flow
1. Define Request/Result models for complex operations
2. Implement transformation logic in appropriate transformer
3. Add DataManager methods using transformers
4. Create reactive publishers for UI updates
5. Test with mock implementations

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### Technical Debt
- **Old RequestProcessor Files**: Need to be removed after testing new architecture
- **Import Dependencies**: May need resolution after architecture changes
- **Test Coverage**: Need to add tests for new transformer layer

### Design Decisions Pending
- **Match Simulation Engine**: How detailed should the simulation be?
- **Player Statistics**: What stats to track and how to display them?
- **League Structure**: How many teams, seasons, and competition formats?

## Project Insights and Learnings

### Architecture Evolution
- **Simplification**: Moving from complex RequestProcessor to simple DataManager + Transformers improved maintainability
- **Clear Boundaries**: Strict model separation prevents architectural violations
- **Testability**: Protocol-based design makes testing much easier

### SwiftUI Patterns
- **ViewModel Usage**: ViewModels work well for presentation state but should not contain business logic
- **Coordinator Integration**: SwiftUI views work well with coordinator pattern when properly abstracted
- **Reactive Updates**: Combine publishers provide clean data flow to UI

### Development Workflow
- **Feature-First**: Building complete features before moving to next one works well
- **Test-Driven**: Having mock implementations from the start improves development speed
- **Documentation**: Keeping architecture docs updated is crucial for complex projects
