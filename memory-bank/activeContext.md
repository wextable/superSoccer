#### ðŸ”„ Current Focus: Unit Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Adding and updating unit tests for all source code files with testable logic
- **Test Infrastructure**: Ensuring all protocols have proper mock implementations
- **Data Layer Testing**: Testing transformers, data managers, and storage operations
- **Navigation Testing**: Testing coordinators, routers, and navigation flows
- **Feature Testing**: Testing interactors, view models, and business logic
- **Design System Testing**: Testing theme components and styling

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Complete Unit Testing Coverage
- **Data Layer Tests**: Complete testing for transformers and data managers
- **Navigation Tests**: Test all coordinator and navigation components
- **Feature Tests**: Test all interactors and business logic
- **Design System Tests**: Test theme components and styling
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete feature flows

### 2. Implement Core Game Features
- **League Feature**: League standings, schedule, and match results
- **Match Simulation**: Basic match simulation engine
- **Player Management**: Enhanced player details and statistics

## Current Technical Decisions

### Architecture Patterns in Use
- **Clean Architecture**: 3-layer data architecture with strict boundaries
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Feature-based navigation with result types
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based with mock implementations
- **Event-Driven**: EventBus for feature communication
- **Request/Result**: Structured operations for complex data flows
- **Tab Navigation**: Centralized tab management with coordinator integration

### Key Implementation Preferences
- **Immutable Client Models**: All Client models use `let` properties
- **ID-Based Relationships**: String IDs instead of object references in Client models
- **Protocol Abstractions**: Every service has a protocol with mock implementation
- **SwiftUI + Combine**: Reactive UI with publisher-based data flow
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All business logic must have unit test coverage

## Active Development Patterns

### Feature Development Flow
1. Create FeatureCoordinator with Result enum
2. Implement Interactor with protocol and mock
3. Build Views with ViewModels for presentation state
4. Add comprehensive unit tests
5. Integrate with navigation system

### Data Operations Flow
1. Define Request/Result models for complex operations
2. Implement transformation logic in appropriate transformer
3. Add DataManager methods using transformers
4. Create reactive publishers for UI updates
5. Test with mock implementations

### Testing Strategy
1. **Protocol-Based Testing**: All dependencies use protocols with mock implementations
2. **Unit Test Coverage**: Every class with business logic must have unit tests
3. **Mock Implementations**: Every protocol has a mock version in #if DEBUG blocks
4. **Test Organization**: Test directories mirror source structure
5. **Integration Testing**: Test complete feature flows and data operations

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### Testing Priorities
- **Data Layer**: Transformers, DataManager, and Storage operations
- **Navigation**: Coordinators, routers, and navigation flows
- **Features**: Interactors, view models, and business logic
- **Design System**: Theme components and styling
- **Integration**: Complete feature flows and data operations

### Design Decisions Pending
- **Match Simulation Engine**: How detailed should the simulation be?
- **Player Statistics**: What statistics to track and display?
- **League Structure**: Number of teams, seasons, and competition format
- **UI Design**: Specific retro styling approach and color scheme

## Project Insights and Learnings

### Architecture Evolution
- **Simplification**: Moving from complex RequestProcessor to simple DataManager + Transformers improved maintainability
- **Clear Boundaries**: Strict model separation prevents architectural violations
- **Testability**: Protocol-based design makes testing much easier
- **Tab Navigation**: Centralized tab management improves navigation consistency

### SwiftUI Patterns
- **ViewModel Usage**: ViewModels work well for presentation state but should not contain business logic
- **Coordinator Integration**: SwiftUI views work well with coordinator pattern when properly abstracted
- **Reactive Updates**: Combine publishers provide clean data flow to UI
- **Tab Integration**: TabContainerView provides clean separation between tab UI and navigation logic

### Development Workflow
- **Feature-First**: Building complete features before moving to next one works well
- **Test-Driven**: Having mock implementations from the start improves development speed
- **Documentation**: Keeping architecture docs updated is crucial for complex projects
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit testing ensures code quality and maintainability
