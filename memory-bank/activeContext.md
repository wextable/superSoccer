- **Mock Pattern**: Comprehensive mock implementations with tracking properties
- **Async Testing**: Using confirmation blocks and withCheckedContinuation patterns
- **Memory Management Testing**: Verifying no retain cycles or memory leaks
- **Protocol-Based Testing**: All dependencies use protocols with mock implementations

### Team Feature Patterns (Template for Other Features)
- **Event Bus Communication**: Views â†’ Interactors via event bus, not direct calls
- **Delegate Pattern**: Interactors â†’ Coordinators via delegate protocol
- **make() Functions**: Only used in previews and DEBUG tests, not production
- **View Model Extraction**: View models declared at file scope, not nested in views
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every business logic class has complete unit test coverage

### UI/UX Architecture
- **Centralized Theming**: SSThemeProvider applied at ViewFactory level for consistent theme management
- **Environment-Based Distribution**: Theme distributed through SwiftUI Environment to all components
- **Component Reusability**: Shared components read theme from environment, ensuring consistency
- **Clean View Structure**: Views broken into computed properties for maintainability

### Architecture Patterns in Use
- **Clean Architecture**: 3-layer data architecture with strict boundaries
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Feature-based navigation with result types
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based with mock implementations
- **Event-Driven**: EventBus for feature communication
- **Request/Result**: Structured operations for complex data flows
- **Tab Navigation**: Centralized tab management with coordinator integration

### Key Implementation Preferences
- **Immutable Client Models**: All Client models use `let` properties
- **ID-Based Relationships**: String IDs instead of object references in Client models
- **Protocol Abstractions**: Every service has a protocol with mock implementation
- **SwiftUI + Combine**: Reactive UI with publisher-based data flow
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All business logic must have unit test coverage

## Active Development Patterns

### Testing Development Flow (Established Template)
1. Create comprehensive InteractorTests covering all business logic
2. Create FeatureCoordinatorTests covering navigation and lifecycle
3. Create Mock delegates with tracking properties and callbacks
4. Use Swift Testing framework with @Test attributes
5. Follow async testing patterns with confirmation blocks
6. Test memory management and cleanup
7. Verify protocol-based dependency injection

### UI Development Flow
1. Apply SSThemeProvider at ViewFactory level for feature screens
2. Use @Environment(\.ssTheme) in components to access theme
3. Break complex views into computed properties for readability
4. Leverage existing design system components (SSPrimaryButton, SSTextFieldStyle, etc.)
5. Ensure proper dark mode support through theme system

### Feature Development Flow
1. Create FeatureCoordinator with Result enum
2. Implement Interactor with protocol and mock
3. Build Views with ViewModels for presentation state
4. Add comprehensive unit tests following Team feature pattern
5. Integrate with navigation system

### Data Operations Flow
1. Define Request/Result models for complex operations
2. Implement transformation logic in appropriate transformer
3. Add DataManager methods using transformers
4. Create reactive publishers for UI updates
5. Test with mock implementations

### Testing Strategy
1. **Protocol-Based Testing**: All dependencies use protocols with mock implementations
2. **Unit Test Coverage**: Every class with business logic must have unit tests
3. **Mock Implementations**: Every protocol has a mock version in #if DEBUG blocks
4. **Test Organization**: Test directories mirror source structure
5. **Integration Testing**: Test complete feature flows and data operations
6. **Swift Testing Framework**: Use modern @Test attributes and confirmation patterns

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### Testing Expansion Priorities
- **Feature Parity**: All features need same testing coverage as Team feature
- **Mock Consistency**: Ensure all mock implementations follow same patterns
- **Test Coverage**: Verify comprehensive coverage across all business logic

### UI Consistency Priorities
- **Remaining Screens**: TeamSelect, Team header improvements, and other screens need retro theming
- **Component Expansion**: May need additional design system components for complex layouts
- **Animation System**: Consider adding consistent animations and transitions

### Design Decisions Resolved
- **Testing Patterns**: Team feature testing patterns established as template
- **Event Bus vs Direct Calls**: Event bus pattern confirmed for view-interactor communication
- **Mock Delegate Pattern**: Comprehensive tracking and callback pattern established
- **Theme Architecture**: Centralized theme application through ViewFactory established
- **Component Reusability**: Environment-based theme distribution pattern confirmed
- **Visual Direction**: Retro aesthetic with cyan accents and proper dark mode support established

### Design Decisions Pending
- **Match Simulation Engine**: How detailed should the simulation be?
- **Player Statistics**: What statistics to track and display?
- **League Structure**: Number of teams, seasons, and competition format
