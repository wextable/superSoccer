#### ðŸ”„ Current Focus: Feature Expansion
- **Apply Retro Theme**: Extend retro styling to remaining screens (TeamSelect, Team, etc.)
- **Component Library**: Expand design system with additional themed components
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all redesigned components

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Extend UI Consistency
- **TeamSelect Screen**: Apply retro theming to team selection interface
- **Team Screen**: Redesign team overview with consistent styling
- **Additional Components**: Create more reusable design system components as needed

### 2. Complete Unit Testing Coverage
- **UI Component Tests**: Test all design system components
- **Feature Tests**: Test redesigned views and their interactions
- **Theme Tests**: Test theme application and dark mode switching

### 3. Implement Core Game Features
- **League Feature**: League standings, schedule, and match results
- **Match Simulation**: Basic match simulation engine
- **Player Management**: Enhanced player details and statistics

## Current Technical Decisions

### UI/UX Architecture
- **Centralized Theming**: SSThemeProvider applied at ViewFactory level for consistent theme management
- **Environment-Based Distribution**: Theme distributed through SwiftUI Environment to all components
- **Component Reusability**: Shared components read theme from environment, ensuring consistency
- **Clean View Structure**: Views broken into computed properties for maintainability

### Architecture Patterns in Use
- **Clean Architecture**: 3-layer data architecture with strict boundaries
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Feature-based navigation with result types
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based with mock implementations
- **Event-Driven**: EventBus for feature communication
- **Request/Result**: Structured operations for complex data flows
- **Tab Navigation**: Centralized tab management with coordinator integration

### Key Implementation Preferences
- **Immutable Client Models**: All Client models use `let` properties
- **ID-Based Relationships**: String IDs instead of object references in Client models
- **Protocol Abstractions**: Every service has a protocol with mock implementation
- **SwiftUI + Combine**: Reactive UI with publisher-based data flow
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All business logic must have unit test coverage

## Active Development Patterns

### UI Development Flow
1. Apply SSThemeProvider at ViewFactory level for feature screens
2. Use @Environment(\.ssTheme) in components to access theme
3. Break complex views into computed properties for readability
4. Leverage existing design system components (SSPrimaryButton, SSTextFieldStyle, etc.)
5. Ensure proper dark mode support through theme system

### Feature Development Flow
1. Create FeatureCoordinator with Result enum
2. Implement Interactor with protocol and mock
3. Build Views with ViewModels for presentation state
4. Add comprehensive unit tests
5. Integrate with navigation system

### Data Operations Flow
1. Define Request/Result models for complex operations
2. Implement transformation logic in appropriate transformer
3. Add DataManager methods using transformers
4. Create reactive publishers for UI updates
5. Test with mock implementations

### Testing Strategy
1. **Protocol-Based Testing**: All dependencies use protocols with mock implementations
2. **Unit Test Coverage**: Every class with business logic must have unit tests
3. **Mock Implementations**: Every protocol has a mock version in #if DEBUG blocks
4. **Test Organization**: Test directories mirror source structure
5. **Integration Testing**: Test complete feature flows and data operations

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### UI Consistency Priorities
- **Remaining Screens**: TeamSelect, Team, and other screens need retro theming
- **Component Expansion**: May need additional design system components for complex layouts
- **Animation System**: Consider adding consistent animations and transitions

### Design Decisions Resolved
- **Theme Architecture**: Centralized theme application through ViewFactory established
- **Component Reusability**: Environment-based theme distribution pattern confirmed
- **Visual Direction**: Retro aesthetic with cyan accents and proper dark mode support established

### Design Decisions Pending
- **Match Simulation Engine**: How detailed should the simulation be?
- **Player Statistics**: What statistics to track and display?
- **League Structure**: Number of teams, seasons, and competition format

## Project Insights and Learnings

### UI/UX Evolution
- **Centralized Theming**: ViewFactory-level theme application provides clean separation of concerns
- **Environment Distribution**: SwiftUI Environment system works excellently for theme distribution
- **Component Architecture**: Extracting reusable components to DesignSystem improves maintainability
- **View Structure**: Breaking views into computed properties significantly improves readability

### Architecture Evolution
- **Simplification**: Moving from complex RequestProcessor to simple DataManager + Transformers improved maintainability
- **Clear Boundaries**: Strict model separation prevents architectural violations
- **Testability**: Protocol-based design makes testing much easier
- **Tab Navigation**: Centralized tab management improves navigation consistency

### SwiftUI Patterns
- **ViewModel Usage**: ViewModels work well for presentation state but should not contain business logic
- **Coordinator Integration**: SwiftUI views work well with coordinator pattern when properly abstracted
- **Reactive Updates**: Combine publishers provide clean data flow to UI
- **Tab Integration**: TabContainerView provides clean separation between tab UI and navigation logic

### Development Workflow
- **Feature-First**: Building complete features before moving to next one works well
- **Test-Driven**: Having mock implementations from the start improves development speed
- **Documentation**: Keeping architecture docs updated is crucial for complex projects
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit testing ensures code quality and maintainability
