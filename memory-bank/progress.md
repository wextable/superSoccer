## Current Status üìä

### Architecture Health: üü¢ Excellent
- Clean separation of concerns established
- Proper dependency injection in place
- Testable design with mock implementations
- Clear data flow patterns

### Feature Completeness: üü° Early Stage
- Basic career creation flow working
- Core navigation structure in place
- Need to implement game simulation features
- UI needs retro styling implementation

### Technical Debt: üü° Manageable
- Old RequestProcessor files need removal
- Some import dependencies may need resolution
- Test coverage needs expansion for new transformer layer
- Documentation needs updates for recent changes

## Known Issues üêõ

### Build Issues
- **Import Dependencies**: May need resolution after architecture refactor
- **SwiftDataManagerFactory**: Needs transformer injection implementation
- **Xcode Build**: Need to verify project builds successfully

### Feature Gaps
- **Tab Navigation**: TabNavigationCoordinator implementation incomplete
- **Match Simulation**: No simulation engine implemented yet
- **Statistics**: No statistics tracking system in place
- **Persistence**: Career data persistence needs testing

### Design Decisions Needed
- **Match Simulation Complexity**: How detailed should match simulation be?
- **Player Statistics**: What statistics to track and display?
- **League Structure**: Number of teams, seasons, competition format
- **UI Design**: Specific retro styling approach and color scheme

## Evolution of Project Decisions üìà

### Architecture Evolution
1. **Initial Simple Architecture**: Basic SwiftUI + SwiftData
2. **RequestProcessor Pattern**: Added complex request processing layer
3. **Clean Architecture Refactor**: Simplified to 3-layer architecture with transformers
4. **Current State**: Clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation

### Navigation Evolution
1. **Simple Navigation**: Basic SwiftUI navigation
2. **Coordinator Pattern**: Implemented feature-based coordinators
3. **Child Management**: Added automatic child coordinator lifecycle
4. **Tab Navigation**: Currently implementing tab-based in-game navigation

### Data Model Evolution
1. **Direct SwiftData**: Initially used SwiftData models throughout
2. **Mixed Models**: Started separating Client and SwiftData models
